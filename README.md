Python based simulation of an ion engine accelerating through the solar system

======

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability of tiny ion engines to accelerate small satellites outside the solar system within a reasonable time frame. The results can be seen most clearly seen in the following plots:
![Jupiter fly-by](1.7kg_4Engines_Assist3/figure_1.png)
This shows the path of the satellite as it exits the solar system. In this case, 4 engines are used to accelerate a 1kg payload. The blue dot highlights a gravity assist from Jupiter.
![Energy plot](1.7kg_4Engines_Assist3/figure_5.png)
Here you can see the kinetic and potential energies of the satellite as it accelerates. The kinetic energy surpasses the potential energy around the Jupiter fly-by which demonstrates that the satellite has reached escape velocity.
